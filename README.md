A program to help solve cryptoquotes, caesar ciphers, or other ciphers in which a single letter of the alphabet is replaced by another in a constant fashion (i.e. the substitutions don't change). It runs frequency analysis on the ciphertext to try and "guess" the answer. The user can then manually set letter substitutions themselves, and the program does frequency analysis for the rest.

Written for fun to help solve a CTF problem. Run the program and type "help" at the prompt for more details.
